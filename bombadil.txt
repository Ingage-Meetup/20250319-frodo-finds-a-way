   “If you’re no stranger to wisdom’ways,"
    Take heed this rune from ancient days.
	It masks the key to hidden truth
	When danger threatens Middle Earth.
	To find the digits that you seek,
	Total what you find unique. 
	This key will shift the garbled text
	And you will know what happens next.
	With wit and wisdom you will know
	The shortest, safest way to go.”
